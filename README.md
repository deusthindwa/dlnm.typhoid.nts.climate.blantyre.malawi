# Distinct climate influences on the risk of typhoid compared to invasive non-typhoid Salmonella disease in Blantyre, Malawi

Invasive Salmonella diseases, both typhoid and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS), are seasonal
bloodstream infections causing important morbidity and mortality globally in Africa. The reservoirs
and transmission of both are not fully understood. We hypothesised that differences in the time-lagged
relationships of rainfall or temperature with typhoid and iNTS incidence might infer differences in
epidemiology. We assessed the dynamics of invasive Salmonella incidence over a 16-year period of
surveillance, quantifying incidence peaks, seasonal variations, and nonlinear effects of rainfall and
temperature exposures on the relative risks of typhoid and iNTS, using monthly lags. An increased
relative risk of iNTS incidence was short-lasting but immediate after the onset of the rains, whereas
that of typhoid was long-lasting but with a two months delayed start, implying a possible difference
in transmission. The relative-risk function of temperature for typhoid was bimodal, with higher risk at
both lower (with a 1 month lag) and higher (with a â‰¥4 months lag) temperatures, possibly reflecting the
known patterns of short and long cycle typhoid transmission. In contrast, the relative-risk of iNTS was
only increased at lower temperatures, suggesting distinct transmission mechanisms. Environmental
and sanitation control strategies may be different for iNTS compared to typhoid disease.
